Here's the questions I am looking for you to answer. Thanks in advance for
sharing your experiences with the lifecycle of building apps. Consider these
questions with respect to a project you want to talk about:

1. Please introduce yourself and describe your role and who you work for.
2. Can you describe your app to us?  What does it do? How does it work?
3. Who is your target audience? Was any research conducted before developing
   the app (market/competitors/functionality)?  Did you do any pre-development
   work beforehand?
4. How long did it take to design and build the app?  
5. What did you have to consider when designing your app?
6. What did you have to consider when developing your app?
7. How many other people were involved in working on the app?  What where their
   roles? (i.e. graphic designers, project managers, developers, testers etc?)
8. What technologies did you use to build your app? Why?  
9. Did you undertake any testing? What was involved?
10. What was the easiest part of building the app? What was the most difficult?
11. How long did it take to get onto the App Store? Did you encounter any issues?
12. Did you undertake any marketing and promotion of your app?  
13. After your app first went live, what was next? Did you update your app,
    action feedback or add new features?
